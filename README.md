# Lava Furnace

Plugin created to make lava a good alternative to normal fuels without the need to manually the lava buckets one at a time.

Each lava furnace has 2 stats:

- Capacity (default 100 cB) = each cB cooks 1 item and a lava bucket restores 100cB
- Speed = you can upgrade the furnace's speed up to x10

This is my first plugin, I will make it fully configurable when needed or when I have time.
